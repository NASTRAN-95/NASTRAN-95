Restart Notes
=============

The D01-01-1B demonstration analysis requires restart files from
D01-01-1A. Any time a change is made to D01-01-1A, the restart files
in D01-01-1B should be updated.

1. Perform analysis D01-01-1A to generate the restart.
2. Copy d01011a.dic to D01-01-1B/rscards
3. Copy d01011a.nptp to D01-01-1B/d01011b.optp
